                                            <p>The Cologne Cathedral, dedicated to St. Peter and the Virgin
                                                Mary, was designed in the tradition of the High Gothic cathedrals of
                                                northern France. <br><br>

                                                Its structure is richly detailed, though somewhat formal in execution,
                                                reflecting an almost scientific precision in both design and
                                                craftsmanship. The cathedral stretches 144.6 meters in length and
                                                rises to about 45 meters in height. <br><br>

                                                While its ground plan draw clear inspiration from Amiens Cathedral, it
                                                also incorporates
                                                distinctive features that set it apart from its French counterparts.

                                            <p>
                                                The Cologne Cathedral features an eight-bay nave and a four-bay choir,
                                                each designed with double aisles—the outer aisles slightly narrower than
                                                the inner ones. Both arms of the transept contain four bays with aisles
                                                on the east and west sides. The two west towers, each built over four
                                                aisle bays, are larger and deeper than those in French cathedrals,
                                                resulting in their impressive height. <br><br>

                                                At the eastern end, the chevet includes an ambulatory with seven
                                                radiating chapels, and the entire structure is covered with
                                                quadripartite rib vaults. While the elevation and cross-section resemble
                                                Amiens Cathedral, Cologne’s design uses slimmer and more numerous
                                                vertical supports, creating a more intricate look. The arcade piers have
                                                molded surfaces and small foliage capitals, and the vault shafts extend
                                                seamlessly upward. The triforium and clerestory are joined by continuous
                                                mullions, each bay containing four windows. The overall height matches
                                                Amiens, but the triforium is positioned lower, dividing the elevation in
                                                a 3:1:3 ratio. <br><br>

                                                windows, and flying buttresses also mirror the French Gothic
                                                style.<br><br>

                                                The 4-meter-high parchment drawing of the west façade guided
                                                19th-century builders during restoration. The lower section reflects the
                                                nave and aisles, with square lower towers that become octagonal higher
                                                up, ending in openwork spires topped with large finials. <br><br>

                                                Unlike the west façade, the transept façades had no medieval plans and
                                                were newly designed by architect Ernst Friedrich Zwirner in the Gothic
                                                Revival style, modeled after the west front.<br><br>

                                                Between 1880 and 1900, mosaic flooring was added to the choir, made from
                                                ceramic tiles produced in Mettlach based on designs by August Ottmar von
                                                Essenwein. These mosaics feature mythological and allegorical scenes,
                                                enriching the cathedral’s artistic interior. <br><br>

                                                the cathedral’s early construction still remain. The only medieval
                                                portal that survives is the St. Peter Portal, located on the west side
                                                of the south tower.<br><br>

                                                This portal features highly detailed sculptures on its jambs and
                                                archivolts, some of which are believed to be the work of Heinrich von
                                                Gmünd. Additionally, earlier sculptural fragments and remnants of
                                                baldachins and gables can still be seen on the south tower.

                                            <p>Inside the Cologne Cathedral, stone figures of Christ, the Virgin
                                                Mary, and the Twelve Apostles adorn the choir piers. Each statue
                                                stands about 2 meters high beneath ornate baldachins, roughly
                                                5 meters above the floor. Except for Christ and the Virgin, the
                                                baldachins are topped with angels playing musical instruments.
                                                Created in the cathedral workshop, these sculptures follow French
                                                Gothic styles, particularly those of Sainte-Chapelle in Paris,
                                                with richly patterned drapery later renewed in the 19th century.<br><br>

                                                The choir preserves many medieval furnishings, including the
                                                Gero Crucifix—the earliest surviving life-size wooden crucifix
                                                from around the 10th century—and the oak choir stalls made between
                                                1308 and 1311, which have 104 seats. The high altar
                                                sculptures, created by artisans from Lorraine, Cologne, and Paris,
                                                show regional stylistic influences. Despite external collaborations, the
                                                cathedral workshop developed its own local style that shaped
                                                Cologne’s sculpture into the 14th century. <br><br>

                                                Among them is the bronze tomb of Archbishop Konrad von Hochstaden,

                                                and replaced with white panes, but during the 19th-century Gothic

                                            Its collection reflects the cathedral’s long history, having suffered
                                            thefts and losses but also gained gifts from bishops, popes, and
                                            emperors. Notable pieces include the Crosier of St. Peter, the Shrine of
                                            the Cross of Cologne (a 12th-century Byzantine triptych), a Late Gothic
                                            monstrance from around 1400, and a Limoges processional crucifix. <br><br>

                                            The treasury’s most famous relic is the golden Shrine of the Three
                                            Kings, created by Nicholas of Verdun, along with illuminated manuscripts
                                            like the Limburg Gospels.<br><br>
